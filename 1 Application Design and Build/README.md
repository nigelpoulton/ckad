# Readme

This course has the following 4 modules:

2. Define, build and modify container images
3. Understand Jobs and CronJobs
4. Understand multi-container Pod design patterns
5. Utilize persistent and ephemeral volumes

There's no item "1." in the list because of the way lessons are numbered internally. So don't worry, nothing is missing.

## Test yourself tasks

Each module folder contains all tasks, answers to tasks, and accompanying code.

## Code

Some modules have a `code` folder for any code accompanying that module. Not all modules have accompanying code.
